title: "About me"

I'm a prompt engineer and future full-stack developer who thrives on building meaningful, real-world solutions with modern web tools. From elegant UIs to powerful backends, I enjoy turning ideas into beautiful, functional applications.

While currently pursuing a bachelor's in Cybersecurity (July 2025), I continue to sharpen my skills across the stack — from React and Svelte on the frontend to Node.js on the backend — blending security awareness with development finesse.
