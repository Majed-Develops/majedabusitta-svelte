## What's New in Next.js 15

### 1. Improved App Router

The App Router has been refined with better performance and developer experience. The new routing system makes it easier to create complex layouts and handle data fetching.

### 2. Enhanced Server Components

Server Components now have better streaming capabilities and improved hydration, making your apps faster and more responsive.

### 3. Turbopack Improvements

While still in beta, Turbopack continues to show impressive performance gains over Webpack, especially for larger applications.

## Getting Started

3. **Optimize Images** - Use the built-in Image component for automatic optimization
4. **Implement Proper SEO** - Use metadata API for better search engine visibility
